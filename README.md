# SequenceGenerator
Solution to a Programming Exercise.

There is a sequence of numbers that can be generated from a starting positive integer, n by:

If n is 1 then the sequence ends.
If n is even then the next n of the sequence = n/2
If n is odd then the next n of the sequence = (3 * n) + 1
In Java, please complete the following 3 tasks:

Task Description:

Create a routine to generate the sequence for a number.
Use the routine to show that the sequence for the number 27 has 112 elements starting with 27, 82, 41, 124 and ending with 8, 4, 2, 
Show the number less than 100,000 which has the longest sequence together with that sequence's length, but don't show the actual sequence!
